# Scheduler
This project includes code that seeks to build master and student schedules for high schools. The method currently in use is a modified hill-climbing approach that involves hill-climbing on master schedules and then hill-climbing individual students' schedules within iteration of the master schedule. To run the code, run [run_schedule.py](https://github.com/matthewjcox/scheduler/blob/master/back_end/run_schedule.py) from the scheduler directory. To change run parameters, edit the text file [run_params.txt](https://github.com/matthewjcox/scheduler/blob/master/runs/run_params.txt).

**TODO: write the rest of the readme -- most of this readme is still just a template**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
