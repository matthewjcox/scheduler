Social Studies| Psychology: Mind, Body, & Behavior| Psych: Brain& Beh| 2900T1| 0.5| 0.50| TJHSST DescriptionPsychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. But everything psychological is simultaneously biological. Every thought, emotion and body movement has biological underpinnings. And yet, we are more than just a collection of neural networks. Our brains have consciousness. The brain seeks to understand itself. The brain somehow gives birth to the mind. TJ's psychology semester elective seeks to explore the connection between the brain and the mind. How important is the brain in shaping behavior? Why do we do what we do? Throughout the course, students will use approaches from a variety of psychological perspectives (social, developmental, evolutionary, cognitive, behavioral, psychoanalytic and biological) to explore this question.DescriptionStudents examine patterns and variations of human behavior and the process of individual human development.

Technology| Specialized Computer Assisted Design| Spec Comp Asst Des| 9828T2| 0.5| 0.50| TJHSST DescriptionThe CAD course is the culmination of a long history of graphical representation of the spatial problem-solving process. This is taught within the context of the Autodesk program Inventor. Unlike previous CAD programs such as AutoCAD, Inventor is a parametric CAD program. What that means is the dimensions, shape, and other key factors in the design are controlled by variables which can be changed at any time, even after the design is complete. In effect, when you design an object in a parametric CAD program you are creating not one design but a whole family of related designs. In the simplest example one can draw a hexagonal nut, change two dimensions and a hole parameter and it will become any hexagonal nut. Change another parameter and it will become a square nut. For increased complexity one can design a generic internal combustion engine.DescriptionStudents develop basic skills in drawing and study careers related to drafting through the use of Computer-Assisted Drafting (CAD) and other software applications to gain an understanding of the technical drawing processes. This course is recommended for students interested in technical drawing, interior design, fashion design, decorating, construction, architecture, or engineering careers.

Social Studies| Ancient and Classical Civilizations| Ancient Civ| 2219T1| 1.0| 0.50| TJHSST DescriptionAncient Civilizations will be an inquiry-based, in-depth course that will offer students an opportunity to investigate the history of the ancient world's major cultures from their beginning to their decline in the post-classical era from an interdisciplinary perspective. Offered as an elective option aimed at 9th and 10th graders to complete their 4th social studies credit, the course will serve as a foundational course that purports to introduce students to research and analytical skills needed in the upper level courses.In terms of content, the course will explore the increasingly interconnected history of major civilizations and other forms of complex societies that arose in pre-classical through post-classical era Afro-Eurasia, focusing on comparative analysis of the sociopolitical, economic, religious, and cultural traditions and innovations that developed in these ancient societies as well as the webs of communication and exchange that connected these societies spatially and temporally. Investigations of cultural traditions will emphasize the development of scientific and technological breakthroughs and innovations, trace the means and routes by which they spread beyond the society in which they emerged, and the regional and cross-regional impact they wielded on the increasingly interconnected pre-modern world. In specific terms, the civilizations studied in the course will range from Mesopotamia and Egypt in the ancient world, to Greece, Rome, Persia, China, and India in the classical world, to the fall of Rome and the rise of the Islamic world in the early-post-classical world.As a foundational course focusing on inquiry learning and the development of higher order thinking, reading, and writing skills, a heavy emphasis will be based on analyzing and evaluating various types of primary and secondary sources. The course will culminate with a final research project that will integrate these skills and focus on the larger themes of the course.DescriptionNoneTextbookStrayer, Robert W. 2011.

Science| AP Biology| AP Biology| 437004| 1.0| 1.00| TJHSST DescriptionAP Biology is a college-level course designed to teach high school students the concepts, factual knowledge, and analytical and critical thinking skills, which will enable them to expand their comprehension of biology with the depth and breadth expected of the highly gifted students at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. The aim of the course is to prepare students for the rigorous biological science courses, which they will encounter in college. It also aims to ensure that students successfully pass the AP Biology Exam, which would enable them to earn college credit. Thus, students who enroll in this course are serious learners who are willing to play an active role in their attainment, integration, and application of knowledge, and thereby enhance their ability to think on a broad scale with a global perspective. Upon completion, students take the Advanced Placement Biology examination.DescriptionAfter completing the core science curriculum, students pursue a more advanced and specialized study of biology topics with the intent of passing the AP Biology exam in May, for which college credit and/or placement may be granted by an approving institution if a qualifying score is achieved. Students conduct standard first year college-level laboratory research as well as analyze and interpret biological data. Students examine biology content with a molecular focus that includes the core theme of structure and function. Highlights include biotechnology such as electrophoresis and bacterial transformation, animal behavior studies and genetic studies. If dissections are part of the laboratory experience, alternatives are available. All students are required to take the Advanced Placement exam.Prerequisites
World Languages| Latin 5| Latin 5| 535000| 1.0| 0.50| TJHSST DescriptionLatin 5 students at Thomas Jefferson will continue their in-depth exploration of the literature of ancient Rome, particularly the poetry of Catullus, Ovid, and Horace. Since this is a post-AP class, students will be expected to have a comfort with all grammatical and literary structures of classical Latin and be able to read and interpret the poetry of the Romans. Greater emphasis will be placed on analysis, discussion, and comparison of the works of different authors. The role of Roman society, as well as the political, and the historical time period will be discussed in relation to its impact upon the author and his work. A continuing focus will be to understand the time periods in the broader context of Western Civilization, and to recognize classical allusions and figures in modern literature. Students will have opportunities to investigate topics of personal interest and will share this information via class presentations and writing assignment. Students completing this course should have no difficulty transitioning to a college upper-level Latin Literature course.DescriptionStudents continue their study of Latin prose and/or poetry, improving their reading proficiency as they deepen their understanding of more complex syntax. Analysis of the Latin texts as literature is emphasized. Students also develop a greater appreciation of the social and political context in which the various works were written as well as their influence upon later literature.TJHSST CommentsThis is a post-AP class. Students must have taken AP Latin: Vergil in order to sign-up for this class.Prerequisites
Summer School| TJHSST Math 6| TJ Math 6| TJA3161| 0.5| 0.50| DescriptionSemester introduction to calculus providing an overview of limits, derivatives, and applications related to those topics.CommentsIdeally students will be prepared for AP Calculus BC through the options and flexibility in the new semester math course sequence. If a student is struggling early on, having the ability to slow down should help prepare students for their required year of calculus by the end of the sequence.
Science| Advanced Astronomy: The Universe| Adv Astr Universe| 4260T5| 0.5| 0.50| TJHSST DescriptionStudents investigate astronomy from the stellar and galactic realm. We begin with the physical properties of stars and stellar evolution how astronomers infer a star's origin and eventual demise. We progress to studies of galaxies, using the Milky Way as our standard for comparison. The Universe on a grand scale then becomes the topic for analysis as we discuss clusters of galaxies and cosmology the origin and evolution of the Universe.DescriptionAstronomy deals with such topics as the universe, universal laws, galaxies, stellar evolution, the solar system and its motion, and the exploration of space. This course is designed to be an in-depth and mathematical treatment of astronomy concepts. This course does not count as one of the science credits for the standard diploma. It can be used as the fourth credit for an advanced studies diploma, if the student has already taken three science courses from three different disciplines.Prerequisites
Technology| Automation and Robotics 1 Robot Design & Prototyping| Aut/Rob-Systems| 9826T8| 0.5| 0.50| TJHSST DescriptionThis semester course explores the building blocks of automated and robotic systems with special emphasis on design and control.
