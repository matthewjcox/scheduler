				<h3><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse4">Why do 9th graders not take a social studies course?</a></h3>
				<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse4"><p>Students at Thomas Jefferson do not take a required history course in their freshman year, since they are required to take a technology course as part of IBET in the slot usually reserved for social studies. As a result, students have the opportunity to choose two semester electives over the course of their TJ education to complete their fourth required social studies credit. Students fare better in these courses after they have some exposure to the skills and rigor required for a high school-level survey social studies course. Therefore, students begin taking these courses either concurrently with World History and Geography 2 in sophomore year, or once that course has been completed.</p></div>

				<h3><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse5">What are the curricular requirements for students to participate in Marching Band (aka Marching Colonials)?</a></h3>
				<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse5"><p>To participate in TJMC you must be a member of the curricular instrumental program (this may include orchestra students at the director's discretion). The exceptions to this rule are as follows:
</p><ul>
<li>Color Guard members do not need to be a member of the curricular program at any time.</li>
<li>Non-curricular instruments (bass guitar, synthesizer, etc - may be from outside the program at the directors discretion)</li>
<li>Once you have completed one year of curricular band (whether you marched that year or not) you are allowed one season of TJMC where you are not in the curricular band.</li>
<li>No instrumental member may be in TJMC if they have not previously been in a curricular program, or are not currently enrolled.</li>

Emphasis is placed on making connections in algebra to geometry and statistics.  Calculator and computer technologies will be used as tools wherever appropriate.  Use of a graphing calculator is considered essential to provide a graphical and numerical approach to topics in addition to a symbolic approach.  Topics include linear equations and inequalities, systems of linear equations, relations, functions, polynomials, and statistics.</p>

						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">TJHSST Description</h5><p>This course is a standard second-semester college course on algorithms and data structures in an object-oriented environment.  The sorting algorithms studied include selection, insertion, merge, quick, and heap.   The data structures studied include arrays, array lists, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, maps, and graphs.  Additional topics include recursion, the Java Collections framework, Big-O analysis, and class design.  The programming language is Java.  Students taking this course should be independent thinkers able to spend a significant amount of time at a computer outside of class.  Approximately 75% of the time is spent learning material that is above and beyond the material on the AP Computer Science A exam, which all enrolled students are required to take.</p>
						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Description</h5><p>The purpose of this course is to prepare students for the Advanced Placement Computer Science A examination, for which college credit and/or placement may be given, if a qualifying score is achieved.  Content of this college-level course corresponds to the syllabus of the College Board Advanced Placement Program for Computer Science A.  Students will design software to solve problems and use data structures, such as classes and arrays, to represent information within a program.  Students will also gain a working knowledge of the major hardware and software components of computer systems.  Java is the main vehicle for implementing solutions to problems.  All students are required to take the Advanced Placement exam.</p>

						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">TJHSST Description</h5><p>This required three-period block integrates instructional objectives of Biology, English 9, and Design and Technology. The IBET Program uses a process-oriented approach to help students establish connections across the disciplines and attain the objectives for each course. Student groups learn to collect data, conduct literature searches, and prepare publications and presentations through long-term project collaborations with private and governmental agencies. Separate grades are awarded for each course.</p>

<p>The goal of the ninth-grade English program is to expose students to various forms of literature that will encourage them to make discoveries about themselves and the world around them. Through studying models of many genres, students sharpen their writing skills by producing their own analytic, creative, and scientific work. Students experience the processes used in writing, working in groups, reading, listening, speaking, and viewing. In each of these areas, they examine their experiences and knowledge. They produce cumulative projects often in the form of class presentations and performances. Components of the course include use of writing logs, participation in book talks, literary discussion groups, writing workshops, and groups formed for special projects.</p>
						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Description</h5><p>English 9 Honors deepens and advances the curriculum of English 9.  Students read and analyze a variety of literary and nonfiction texts, exploring the characteristics of different forms and the techniques authors use to achieve their intended purpose.  Language study extends students' vocabulary through learning about connotations, denotations, word origins, and structures.  Students apply their understanding of grammar, capitalization, punctuation, spelling, sentence structure, and paragraphing to varied and frequent writing assignments.  Through narrative, expository, and persuasive writings, students build on their understanding of writing as a process of prewriting, drafting, revising, and publishing.  In the research process, students find, evaluate, and select appropriate sources to access information to create a research product.  They also develop communication skills through listening to and practicing oral presentations.  (This is a Standards of Learning aligned course, which is tested in 11th grade.)</p>

						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">TJHSST Description</h5><p>This course examines the connection between literature and politics through the examination of ways writers and politicians use language to tell a story, create an effect, evoke an emotional response, or persuade a nation. The purpose of the course is to promote students' independent ability to read, write, and analyze both literary and nonfiction works and to develop an understanding of themselves as members of a civil society. The study of topics such as the role of the individual in a political system, elections and campaigns, and the proper role of government combine with an analysis of novels such as 1984, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, and All the King's Men as well as essays, poetry, and Shakespeare (Hamlet or Othello) to deepen students understanding of the interplay between language and power. Students write frequently for a variety of audiences and purposes to learn, to explore an idea, to analyze and interpret, and to express themselves imaginatively. Students also engage in individual and group activities including Model Congress, writing and reading groups, and Socratic seminars. Upon completion, students take the Advanced Placement examinations for Literature and Composition and for US Government and Politics.</p>

						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">TJHSST Description</h5><p>This course is equivalent to a third semester college calculus course. Students investigate the geometry of three-dimensional curves and surfaces, and extend the single-variable concepts of derivatives and integrals to three and more dimensions. The process of finding a minimum or maximum value of a function of several variables is illustrated, and the techniques used to find the volume of a three-dimensional region and the average value of a given function over such a region are explored. Differential and integral calculus of several variables are the focal points of this college-level course which extends the BC Calculus experience to three dimensions, culminating in several calculus applications to physics including Stokes', Green's, and Gauss' Theorems. Dual enrollment with GMU is offered for this course to those who are interested, but this option is not required.</p>

They'll also learn to spot patterns in economic behavior and how to use those patterns to explain buyer and seller behavior under different economic conditions. Microeconomics studies the economic way of thinking, understanding the nature and function of markets, the role of scarcity and competition, the influence of factors such as interest rates on business decisions, and the role of government in promoting a healthy economy. The equivalent of an introductory college-level course, AP Microeconomics prepares students for the AP Exam and for further study in business, history, and political science.</p>

<p>AP Macroeconomics students learn why and how the world economy can change from month to month, how to identify trends in our economy, and how to use those trends to develop performance measures and predictors of economic growth or decline. They'll also examine how individuals, institutions, and influences affect people, and how those factors can impact everyone's life through employment rates, government spending, inflation, taxes, and production. The equivalent of a 100-level college-level class, this course prepares students for the AP Exam and for further study in business, political science, and history.</p>

Students are exposed to the psychological facts, principles, and phenomena associated with each of the major subfields within psychology. They also learn about the methods psychologists use in their science and practice. The aim of Advanced Placement Psychology is to provide the students with a learning experience equivalent to that obtained in an introductory college psychology course. College credit and/or placement may be given if a qualifying score is made on the Advanced Placement examination. The rigorous course syllabus and college level texts both suggest that students who enroll should be highly motivated and intellectually curious.</p>

						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">TJHSST Description</h5><p>The honors level freshman Biology course at TJHSST is molecular based introductory course with emphasis on chemistry for biology students, cell biology, bioenergetics, DNA science, evolution, ecology, and human anatomy and physiology. The course is designed with two purposes in mind. First, it provides the content and skills foundation for the entire scientific program at the school. In particular, the Biology curriculum prepares students for the Advance Placement (AP) Biology course. Second, the course represents one element of IBET that links these distinctive disciplines so that scientific concepts, language arts, and engineering innovation are seamlessly woven together in a way that is realistic and relevant to students. As such, the Biology course demonstrates cohesive horizontal articulation (including the constraints of the unique integrated project work done by each team) among the various Biology classes, while also targeting vertical articulation in support of upper-class courses. Each IBET team requires the development of a year-long research project designed and conducted by students in small groups. Collaboration is stressed to prepare students for increased demands by industry for strong interpersonal skills as well as technical competencies. The Fairfax County Public Schools Family Life Education (FLE) instruction occurs at the end of the school year. Upon completion of Biology 1, students will take the Virginia Biology standards of learning end-of-course test.</p>
						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Description</h5><p>In Biology 1 Honors, students engage in scientific inquiry as they explore biological processes.  All class activities and laboratory activities focus on life processes that occur within organisms or cells as well as the characteristics of life including: reproduction, development, and adaptation to environment.  Major topics of study include molecular biology, cells, genetics, organisms, evolution and ecology.  In comparison to Biology 1, students will investigate some topics at a deeper level including biotechnology, health and environmental issues.  Students will be involved in an externally-moderated experimental/research project, either independently or in teams.  The course includes a unit on human life education that addresses the topics of human reproduction and human development.  Parents have the option of withdrawing their child from any or all topics included in the state-mandated Family Life Education portion.  Students opting-out will be provided with alternative biology lessons.  If dissections are a part of the laboratory experience, alternatives are available.</p>

Students expand their knowledge of continuum systems, statistical physics, and systems with emergent properties with an emphasis on building inherently discrete computational models of continuum systems continuum and the application of partition functions to interacting systems in statistical mechanics via a hands-on, model building approach to learning. Two main topics are covered: Basic Techniques for Creating Discrete Models for Continuum Classical Systems in one and two space dimensions and an introduction to Classical Statistical Mechanics through an extensive treatment of the Ising model in two dimensions. If time allows the balance of the class will be spent creating and interpreting computational models of two state Quantum systems and their composites. No prior experience with Mathematica is assumed but students must have experience in and enjoy programming / creating their own computational models to get the most out of this course. Students spend approximately half their class time developing and testing computational models in collaboration with their peers.</p>

Building on the foundation of the strong AP Physics-C course, students extend their understanding of Space-Time, Electromagnetic fields and interactions during the first semester,; with an emphasis on dynamic electromagnetic fields and waves starting from Maxwell's Equations in differential and integral form. Einstein's conception of space-time, embodied in Special Relativity, is developed to produce a consistent description of electromagnetic fields, forces, and interactions. Classical electrodynamics, and classical wave optics are developed in a rigorous mathematical treatment.<br>Quantum Mechanics is introduced after winter break in the physical context of Quantum Optics and finite-state systems which brings together fundamental quantum mechanics, electromagnetic fields, and the interaction of photons with matter,. The development includes contemporary research areas and modern applications of quantum mechanics including quantum entanglement, the quantum description of photo production and detection, select topics in solid state physics and nano technology. The last quarter of the course introduces basic concepts in Quantum Computing and Quantum Cryptography, with an attendant examination of fundamental quantum mechanics of entangled states and Bell's theorem. The course ends with a brief description of the structure and physical concepts of the fully relativistic quantum theory: Quantum Electrodynamics.<br>This course is intended for students who enjoyed AP Physics-C and wish to understand the fundamental physics of space-time, electromagnetic fields, and quantum mechanics. Strong quantitative problem solving skills as demonstrated in AP Physics-C and advanced mathematics courses at TJ as well as an eagerness to learn through problem solving are requirements for success in this post-AP course.<br>Students should plan on spending a minimum of 6 hours per week on homework for the class.</p>

Bionanotechnology is the relatively new field that focuses on the interface between technology and very small biological systems. The course will be conducted primarily as a seminar, and students will read papers on how biological systems and processes could be adapted for use in todays society.

Offered as an elective option aimed at 9th and 10th graders to complete their 4th social studies credit, the course will serve as a foundational course that purports to introduce students to research and analytical skills needed in the upper level courses.<br>In terms of content, the course will explore the increasingly interconnected history of major civilizations and other forms of complex societies that arose in pre-classical through post-classical era Afro-Eurasia, focusing on comparative analysis of the sociopolitical, economic, religious, and cultural traditions and innovations that developed in these ancient societies as well as the webs of communication and exchange that connected these societies spatially and temporally. Investigations of cultural traditions will emphasize the development of scientific and technological breakthroughs and innovations, trace the means and routes by which they spread beyond the society in which they emerged, and the regional and cross-regional impact they wielded on the increasingly interconnected pre-modern world. In specific terms, the civilizations studied in the course will range from Mesopotamia and Egypt in the ancient world, to Greece, Rome, Persia, China, and India in the classical world, to the fall of Rome and the rise of the Islamic world in the early-post-classical world.<br>As a foundational course focusing on inquiry learning and the development of higher order thinking, reading, and writing skills, a heavy emphasis will be based on analyzing and evaluating various types of primary and secondary sources. The course will culminate with a final research project that will integrate these skills and focus on the larger themes of the course.</p>

Beginning with a foundational understanding of the world before 1500 C.E., the course focuses primarily on cultural developments from 1500 C.E. to the present. Students explore a variety of genres in reading and writing. In addition to refining research skills and habits of mind associated with the course curriculum, students have opportunities to incorporate learning in a variety of creative presentations.</p>
						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Description</h5><p>This is the second of a two-year, chronologically and thematically organized study of world history and geography.  In this second year, students study the world from 1500 CE through the present.  The course weaves together the skills and content of both history and geography so that students may learn how both affect  the world around them.  Regions of study include North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.  Students continue to examine the relationship among social, economic, and geopolitical developments across time and place.

						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">TJHSST Description</h5><p>This course is a team-taught, interdisciplinary study of American history, literature and culture from pre-Columbian times to the present. Many of the assignments and activities in Humanities 2 are designed to provide teachers and students opportunities to explore relationships between the two subjects. The class focuses on specific historical and literary themes and events in American history emphasizing critical reading and writing, group work, and individual and group projects. Students not only learn about the American experience at a survey level, but also investigate primary source documents that give voice to the major ideas of each time period. These texts serve as a springboard for independent, ongoing research.</p>

<p>In the history portion of this course, students learn to assess historical materials, their relevance to a given interpretive problem, their reliability and their importance. They weigh evidence and varied interpretations presented in historical scholarship, while refining their language, learning, and communication skills.</p>

<p>Upon completion, students take the Advanced Placement examination in AP U.S. History.</p>

<p>Historical skills that are emphasized include analysis, argumentation, chronological reasoning, interpretation, contextualization, comparison, and synthesis.</p>
						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Description</h5><p>In this course students develop the factual knowledge and analytical skills necessary to deal with the issues and problems of American History.  They do in-depth analysis of major developments; become familiar with primary sources; assess historical materials, evidence, and interpretations; and learn to write research papers.  This course prepares students to take the Advanced Placement examination in American History for which college credit and/or placement may be given if a qualifying score is made.  The course is equal to a full-year introductory college course.  Completion of this course fulfills the graduation requirement for one credit in Virginia and United States History.</p>

In the physical/biological half, the focus is human evolution and non-human primates such as monkeys and great apes. A visit to the primate collection of the National Zoo is standard. The second half is organized around the study of human society and culture. Through readings, class discussions, presentations, and videos, the class explores what it means to be human. Topics include: similarities and differences among cultures; social and economic characteristics; customs, traditions, taboos, and beliefs; and how anthropology, through its distinctive methods, can clarify our understanding of each other and ourselves. A variety of guest speakers working in the subfields of anthropology enrich the course, and depending on availability may include primatologists, forensic anthropologists, archaeologists, and ethnographers. Emphasis is placed on responsible participation in group and class activities such as team projects, class discussions, reading, writing, and research.</p>

Without this knowledge, we would lack the context for understanding the development of contemporary institutions, the role of continuity and change in present-day society and politics, and the evolution of current forms of artistic expression and intellectual discourse. In addition to providing a basic narrative of events and movements, the goals of A.P. European History are to develop (a) an understanding of some of the principal themes in modern European history, (b) an ability to analyze historical evidence and historical interpretations, and (c) an ability to express historical understanding in writing. This course does not qualify for the 4th social studies credit.</p>

In addition, students are expected to demonstrate an ability to analyze historical evidence and to express that understanding and analysis in writing.

						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">TJHSST Description</h5><p>This course examines the connection between literature and politics through the examination of ways writers and politicians use language to tell a story, create an effect, evoke an emotional response, or persuade a nation. The purpose of the course is to promote students' independent ability to read, write, and analyze both literary and nonfiction works and to develop an understanding of themselves as members of a civil society. The study of topics such as the role of the individual in a political system, elections and campaigns, and the proper role of government combine with an analysis of novels such as 1984, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, and All the King's Men as well as essays, poetry, and Shakespeare (Hamlet or Othello) to deepen students understanding of the interplay between language and power. Students write frequently for a variety of audiences and purposes: to learn, to explore an idea, to analyze and interpret, and to express themselves imaginatively. Students also engage in individual and group activities including Model Congress, writing and reading groups, and Socratic seminars. Upon completion, students take the Advanced Placement examinations for Literature and Composition and for US Government and Politics. Separate grades are awarded for each course.</p>

How important is the brain in shaping behavior? Why do we do what we do? Throughout the course, students will use approaches from a variety of psychological perspectives (social, developmental, evolutionary, cognitive, behavioral, psychoanalytic and biological) to explore this question.</p>
						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Description</h5><p>Students examine patterns and variations of human behavior and the process of individual human development. They identify and examine the emotional, intellectual, and physical factors which influence the development of the individual human being. Students distinguish among the major schools and systems of psychology and methods of investigation.</p>

						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Description</h5><p>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the systematic and scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of human beings and other animals.  Students are exposed to the psychological facts, principles, and phenomena associated with each of the major subfields within psychology.  They also learn about the methods psychologists use in their science and practice.  The aim of Advanced Placement Psychology is to provide the students with a learning experience equivalent to that obtained in an introductory college psychology course.  College credit and/or placement may be given if a qualifying score is made on the Advanced Placement examination.  The rigorous course syllabus and college level texts both suggest that students who enroll should be highly motivated and intellectually curious.</p>

						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">TJHSST Description</h5><p>This course offers students an opportunity to investigate various philosophies and topics in western thought from the time of the earliest Greek philosophers to the present. The goal in this class is to further individual philosophical exploration and understanding by reflecting on the concepts proposed by philosophers of the past and critically analyzing how applicable those ideas are to individuals and society today. Students will examine philosophical methods and develop critical skills by writing and discussing philosophical arguments on selected topics and by writing their own philosophical statement. Students will also distinguish between systematic philosophical investigation and personal belief and opinion, and value the rich ideas and points of view on many issues, both classical and modern.</p>
						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Description</h5><p>This course offers students an opportunity to investigate classical philosophical issues from both secular and religious sources. A study of philosophy will help students to value more fully the insights and structures of the great philosophies; respect the difference between systematic philosophical investigation and personal belief; develop critical skill in the analysis of the writings of the philosophers and a comprehensive understanding of similarities and differences in philosophical discussion, both religious and secular, throughout the ages; value the rich diversity of ideas and points of view on many issues; and transfer philosophical knowledge and method to the study of other disciplines and to problem solving.</p>

Offered as an elective option aimed at 9th and 10th graders to complete their 4th social studies credit, the course will serve as a foundational course that purports to introduce students to research and analytical skills needed in the upper level courses.<br>In terms of content, the course will explore the increasingly interconnected history of major civilizations and other forms of complex societies that arose in pre-classical through post-classical era Afro-Eurasia, focusing on comparative analysis of the sociopolitical, economic, religious, and cultural traditions and innovations that developed in these ancient societies as well as the webs of communication and exchange that connected these societies spatially and temporally. Investigations of cultural traditions will emphasize the development of scientific and technological breakthroughs and innovations, trace the means and routes by which they spread beyond the society in which they emerged, and the regional and cross-regional impact they wielded on the increasingly interconnected pre-modern world. In specific terms, the civilizations studied in the course will range from Mesopotamia and Egypt in the ancient world, to Greece, Rome, Persia, China, and India in the classical world, to the fall of Rome and the rise of the Islamic world in the early-post-classical world.<br>As a foundational course focusing on inquiry learning and the development of higher order thinking, reading, and writing skills, a heavy emphasis will be based on analyzing and evaluating various types of primary and secondary sources. The course will culminate with a final research project that will integrate these skills and focus on the larger themes of the course.</p>

Due to its enabling roles in fields from the life sciences and agriculture to engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology, chemistry is often regarded as the central science. This unique centrality is emphasized through class dialogue, activities, and laboratory experiments in which students observe and analyze chemical systems in order to bolster conceptual understanding. As fundamentals are developed, students continue to deepen their grasp of the molecular basis of macroscopic properties and phenomena and examine principles and questions of increasing complexity. Upon completion of Chemistry 1, students will take the Virginia Chemistry standards of learning end-of-course test.</p>
						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Description</h5><p>Chemistry 1 Honors provides students the opportunity to utilize their strong critical thinking skills and apply their mathematical knowledge as they investigate in depth the composition, properties, and reactions of matter.

						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">TJHSST Description</h5><p>Each of the three CHUM courses covers the substantive material required and includes development and practice of higher-order critical thinking and other important skills. On the other hand, combining Chemistry, World History/Geography II and World Literature as CHUM affords a more flexible schedule and interdisciplinary approach to these subjects. Our CHUM classes will meet on Red Days, enabling teachers to reallocate the duration of individual CHUM classes and include joint meetings in T-13/14, the auditorium, or cafeteria when desired. The Red Day schedule also means that students can participate in CHUM field trips without missing other academic classes. CHUM builds on the IBET experience and facilitates closer collaboration with other students who share these courses and field trips.</p>

<p>CHUM students will supplement independent Chem, History, and English coverage and instruction with joint, team-taught projects such as the following:</p>

<p>- A major US chemical company's slogan earlier was along the lines of "better living through chemistry." We will launch our joint studies with a TED talk spurring our consideration of an overarching CHUM question: to what extent are we living better through chemistry? What are the burdens as well as benefits of chemistry as we humans apply it? This TED speaker focuses on plastics, products of chemical innovation that both help and threaten humanity and other species. We'll consider the history of this development, as well as the way it is reflected in literature and the arts. We'll also practice evaluating the oral communications skills in this presentation, with a view to improving our own. To boot, students may later develop their own TED talks!<br>- As students study the elements, their properties, and significance, in English we'll complement that focus with creative writing about an element. What's the icing on the cake for this CHUM unit? What else: we'll create (and consume) a table of elements in cupcakes! (Baking is an art based on chemistry.)<br>- CHUMmers will consider the chemistry of paints and painting, signature advances in painting during the Renaissance, and ongoing study and application of chemistry-based conservation techniques used to protect and preserve the life of priceless paintings. We'll also appreciate that despite general advances, mistakes and setbacks color art history as well.<br>- We plan to complement our painting studies with a field trip to the Lunder Conservatory, where we'll meet with and observe curators in action.<br>- When history proceeds to the development of photography and film, we'll focus on the chemistry of these critical technological developments and their use to capture history and become new artistic media themselves. In particular, we'll examine closely the chemistry of film and film's use as both art and propaganda in the Russian Rebellion of 1905, the Communist and Nazi movements, and WWII.<br>- We'll explore Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson's Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History. Chemistry looms large in history, and literature and the arts reflect virtually all major human developments including in science.<br>- As an interdisciplinary research project, students will select and study a use and/or misuse/abuse of chemistry outside the US in the twentieth century, and develop and support a narrowly tailored thesis regarding its historical significance.<br>- As a culminating project, CHUMmers will make a video or alternative genre of educational performance art that explores a chemical challenge to or opportunity in our global environment and urges public action. Students will use these projects authentically by displaying, showing, or sharing them with appropriate public institutions, non-governmental organizations, or other potential collaborators such as perhaps middle schools or more TED "talks."</p>

<p>Joint projects will be assessed in more than one class and students will be apprised in advance of expectations, rubrics, and scoring.</p>

This course focuses on authentic world problems of interest and significance that derive from and affect the evolving phenomenon of globalization, often using the resources of the Washington, D.C. area. The study of global issues involves problem solving scenarios, presentations of findings, and simulations. Readings include current periodicals, literature with an emphasis on international connections, and texts by noted experts in globalization. Students research and write about these issues in forms such as editorials, columns, position papers, feature stories, and creative writing. In English, students study journalistic models as well as classical rhetorical types of writing and the type of personal writing used in the college application process. In government class, students study AP U.S. Government topics, emphasizing the making of foreign policy and international economic relations. The course is taught both separately as Eng. and Govt. classes and together for quarter projects and special events such as video conferences and field trips. Upon completion, students take the Advanced Placement examinations in AP Government and AP Language and Composition.</p>

						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">TJHSST Description</h5><p>The CAD course is the culmination of a long history of graphical representation of the spatial problem-solving process. This is taught within the context of the Autodesk program Inventor. Unlike previous CAD programs such as AutoCAD, Inventor is a parametric CAD program. What that means is the dimensions, shape, and other key factors in the design are controlled by variables which can be changed at any time, even after the design is complete. In effect, when you design an object in a parametric CAD program you are creating not one design but a whole family of related designs. In the simplest example one can draw a hexagonal nut, change two dimensions and a hole parameter and it will become any hexagonal nut. Change another parameter and it will become a square nut. For increased complexity one can design a generic internal combustion engine.</p>
						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Description</h5><p>Students develop basic skills in drawing and study careers related to drafting through the use of Computer-Assisted Drafting (CAD) and other software applications to gain an understanding of the technical drawing processes. This course is recommended for students interested in technical drawing, interior design, fashion design, decorating, construction, architecture, or engineering careers.</p>

						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">TJHSST Description</h5><p>Advanced Placement Studio Art allows students to work in one particular area of art or design of their choosing. A student may select a focus from: Painting and Drawing, Computer Graphics, Photography, or 3-D Design. Students are encouraged to work more independently and to respond to personal and global issues through their preferred medium while establishing an individual voice and style of communication. Ultimately, students will create a portfolio of their work for advanced placement review. This course requires a student materials fee as listed in FCPS Notice 5922.</p>
						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Description</h5><p>This course is designed for highly motivated, advanced art students who have demonstrated a serious interest in the study of art.  Ideally suited for students who work well independently, the course will focus on the preparation of a drawing portfolio of artworks that exhibit quality, concentration in an area of visual interest or problem solving, and breadth of experience in the formal, technical, and expressive means of an artist.  The drawing portfolio addresses a broad interpretation of drawing issues including painting, printmaking, studies for sculpture, some forms of design, and abstract and observational works.  Students will prepare and submit drawing portfolios based on objectives that reflect the format and requirements established by the College Board for Advanced Placement Studio Art.  Advanced Placement college credit and/or placement may be awarded if a qualifying exam score is achieved.

						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">TJHSST Description</h5><p>AP Art History provides the same exciting course of study as a college art history course: an understanding and knowledge of architecture, sculpture, painting and other forms of art, within their social/historical contexts. Students will examine and critically analyze major artworks from the past and present, within a variety of cultures. These include a chronology from Paleolithic art through the present. While the emphasis will be on Western Art traditions, a minimum of 20% of the course comes from beyond the European tradition. As the name implies, art history is the study of art and the study of history. While a visual analysis (formal critique) is emphasized, the cultural context, history, politics, religion, patronage, gender issues, function, effect and audience of each work are crucial to the study of art history. Art history is based not primarily on memorization of facts, but rather on specific historical contexts shaped by the forces of time, place, events, culture, social change, and the activities of individual artists and patrons. In this course works of art are viewed as products of specific times and places.</p>
						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Description</h5><p>Students develop an understanding of works of art within their historical context by examining issues such as politics, religion, patronage, gender, function, and ethnicity. The course also addresses visual analysis, aesthetics, and criticism. Students should demonstrate a high degree of commitment to academic work and possess academic skills needed to pursue a program designed to meet college standards. The course is designed to prepare students for the Advanced Placement Art History examination, for which college credit and/or placement may be awarded if a qualifying score is achieved. Objectives for Advanced Placement courses reflect the format and requirements in the Advanced Placement Course Description for Art<br>published by the College Board. No prior experience in art studio or art history is assumed. All students are required to take the Advanced Placement Art History exam.</p>

For more information, see www.actfl.org.Level 1 is designed to develop a practical level of proficiency in the language. Through a collaborative approach in an immersion classroom environment, students learn the correct pronunciation of the language, and become increasingly comfortable understanding and speaking the target language. Target language communication in the classroom by students and teacher will increase throughout the year, reaching a level of 85%-90% of class time. Through the use of a thematic syllabus, students master the vocabulary and basic grammatical structures needed to communicate in the language about such themes as family, school life, free time activities, food, shopping, holidays, and geography of the country. They also read authentic material appropriate to their level, and gain listening skills through the use of CD, videos, radio, Internet, podcasts, and other audio programs. Since research is an integral part of the learning experience at TJHSST, students will use textbook materials, media, the library and Internet and other technologies to access and present cultural knowledge of the countries where their language is spoken.</p>
						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Description</h5><p>Students develop the ability to communicate about themselves and their immediate environment using simple sentences containing basic language structures. This communication is evidenced in all four language skills - listening, speaking, reading and writing - with emphasis on the ability to communicate orally and in writing. Students begin to explore and study the POS themes of Personal and Family Life, School Life, Social Life, and Community Life. For middle school students, this credit becomes a part of the high school transcript, is included in the determination of the high school grade point average (GPA), and counts toward fulfilling the world languages requirement of the high school Advanced Studies diploma. It also counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation.</p>

Students begin to explore and study the POS themes of Personal and Family Life, School Life, Social Life, and Community Life. For middle school students, this credit becomes a part of the high school transcript, is included in the determination of the high school grade point average (GPA), and counts toward fulfilling the world languages requirement of the high school Advanced Studies diploma.

Through the use of a thematic syllabus, students master the vocabulary and basic grammatical structures needed to communicate in the language about such themes as family, school life, free time activities, food, shopping, holidays, and geography of the country. They also read authentic material appropriate to their level, and gain listening skills through the use of CD, videos, radio, Internet, podcasts, and other audio programs. Since research is an integral part of the learning experience at TJHSST, students will use textbook materials, media, the library and Internet and other technologies to access and present cultural knowledge of the countries where their language is spoken.</p>
						<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Description</h5><p>Students continue to develop proficiency in all four language skills - listening, speaking, reading, and writing - with emphasis on the ability to communicate orally and in writing. They learn to function in real-life situations using more complex sentences and language structures. They read material on familiar topics and produce short writing samples. Students continue to explore as they study the POS themes of Home Life, Student Life, Leisure Time, and Vacation and Travel.</p>
